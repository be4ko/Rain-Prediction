# Rain Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview 
This project leverages a machine-learning approach to predict rain based on a weather dataset. We preprocess the data, implement multiple algorithms, and analyze their performance using key evaluation metrics. Additionally, a custom implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm is developed and compared with Scikit-learn's kNN.

 
## Features 
- Scale features to ensure consistency.
- Split the dataset into training and testing subsets for evaluation.
- Develop a custom kNN implementation from scratch.
- Plot decision trees to explain the prediction process.
- Generate detailed reports on the decision tree and kNN results.
